# LHL Scheduler

Scheduler is a basic application created for <a href="www.lighthouselabs.ca">LightHouseLabs.ca</a> to exercise our skills to date in the course with Javascript and ReactJS.  An introduction to Storybook React component builder was also implemented.

Scheduler also builds upon our learning to implement Jest and Cypress test platforms.  * Test modules were extensively modified to work with our extra features like modal windows in this version.

## Bonus features...
- start app on "today" vs a default of Monday - if used on Saturday or Sunday, then default to Monday
- prevent opening form/edits if delete confirmation panel is open
- limit interview add form to only 1 spot at a time (original code allowed multiple forms open needlessly)
- create modal window react component for:
  - cookies notice and privacy policy modal windows
  - about Scheduler modal window
- create reusable "tooltips" react component
- add social media links
